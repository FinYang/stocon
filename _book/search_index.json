["_main.html", "Untitled", " Untitled Typically, we face the problem of solving \\[V_0(x_0)=\\sup_{{\\mathbf{c}}_0}{\\mathbb{E}}[\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\\delta^{t}u(X_t,c_t)+U(X_T)\\delta^T]\\] such that \\({\\mathbf{c}}_0=\\{c_0,c_1,...c_{T-1}\\}\\) and the state evolves according to \\[\\begin{equation} X_{t+1}=g(X_t,\\epsilon_t) \\in \\R^d \\end{equation}\\] exogenous shocks \\(\\epsilon \\in {\\mathbf{R}}^d\\). Rewriting in the Bellman equation format, we have \\[V_t(x)=\\sup_{{\\mathbf{c}}_t}u(x,c_t)+{\\mathbb{E}}[V_{t+1}(X_{t+1})|X_t=x]\\] with the boundary condition \\[V_T(x)=U(x).\\] In order to solve this, the dynamic problem start at \\(T-1\\), one needs to solve the optimization problem at each time and iterate the valuation backwards. In simple dynamic program, problems arise when the dimension \\(d\\) is large. At each time, \\(t\\), the \\({\\mathbb{E}}_t\\) is conditioning on \\(\\sigma(X_t)\\), one cannot easily derive it analytically, hence making the optimization cumbersome to solve. Numerical approximation schemes, e.g. Monte-Carlo, can be used together with dynamic problem for solving this type of problems, but its numerical performance and theoretical properties are highly dependent on the structure of the problem considered. Instead, we consider a single index \\[ Y_t=s(X_t,\\beta_t) \\in {\\mathbf{R}}\\] and rewrite the Bellman equation into \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{single_bell} V_t(y)=\\sup_{\\bc_t,\\bbeta_t}u(y,c_t)+\\E[V_{t+1}(Y_{t+1})|Y_t=y] \\mbox{ for } \\bbeta_t=\\{\\beta_t,\\beta_2,...,\\beta_{T}\\} \\end{equation}\\] with the boundary condition \\[ V_T(y)=U(y). \\] such that \\[ Y_{t+1}=s(g(X_t,\\epsilon_t) ,\\beta_{t+1}). \\] We have now effectively reduced the d-dimensional problem into one, and know the problem becomes to finding the distribution \\(F_t(y;\\beta_t)\\) of \\(Y_t\\) in order to evaluate the integral. Our idea is to use the empirical distribution \\(F^n_t(y; \\beta_t)\\). Suppose given this empirical distribution, the optimal controls in equation ( ) can be solved exactly. We would like to analysis the convergence behaviour of the resulting \\(V_0(x_0)^n\\) to the true \\(V_0(x_0)\\). "]
